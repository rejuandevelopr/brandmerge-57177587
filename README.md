# Qloo LLM Hackathon project

## Project info

BrandMerge

BrandMerge is a smart collaboration discovery platform that helps small and mission-driven brands find the right partnership opportunities by matching them based on shared cultural tastes, audience overlap, and strategic collaboration goals. Powered by AI and rich cultural data, BrandMerge goes beyond surface-level matches to generate actionable insights, growth forecasts, and synergy reports.

Features:

Cultural & Audience-Based Matching
Discover brands that align not only by industry but also by shared audience interests, influencer followings, geographic focus, and values.

AI-Driven Synergy Insights
Leveraging the Qloo Taste AI™ API and OpenAI ChatGPT API to generate detailed synergy analysis, growth opportunity forecasts, and collaboration ideas, making recommendations highly actionable.

User-Friendly Dashboard
Easily browse, filter, and sort through curated brand matches with alignment scores, collaboration readiness badges, and next-step suggestions.

Email Verification Flow
New users verify their email through a secure link sent from Supabase, ensuring authenticity before accessing the platform.

Signup & Email Verification Flow (Supabase)
- When a user signs up with their email and password, the system sends a verification email to the signup email address to confirm its authenticity.
- A verification email is sent via Supabase.
- Clicking the verification link redirects to a blank page but verifies the email behind the scenes.
- Verified users can then log in with their credentials.

Quick Login (for demo) incase needed.
